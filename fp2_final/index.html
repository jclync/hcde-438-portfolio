        <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The core functionality of this project was to create the final version for my final project. Since I really enjoyed creating a game for MP3, 
          I chose to create a new game: Boba Run (similar to Cookie Run and Google's dino run game pictured below). 
          <a title="boba run game" href="https://jclync.github.io/boba-run/"> Play Boba Run here</a>!

           cloned to your own device -- note, you will need to install libraries, run a local development server, bundle the 
           code, and deploy the app on your own device.

                <li>added collectable boba (like coins in PacMan) to add to the game score</li>
                <li>added animation to the character sprites to make them non-static</li>

        <h3>Issue: Sprite Animation</h3>
        <div class="issue-container">
          <div class="issue-description">
            <p class="issue-paragraph">
              One issue that I ran into was that I wanted animate my game sprites as they were showing only as static images in the game. 
              I had set the sprite image to a url path to a gif image file. In the p5 web editor, they were animated, but once my game was deployed, the sprites were static.

            <p class="issue-paragraph">
              By doing a search online, I found a github issues page that explained why gifs do not show as animated. 
              This has something to do with the frame rate that the canvas is drawn, which makes animated gif files 
              only display as static images that do not move.
              <br /><br />
              A workaround around this issue was to use the 
              <a title="p5.play sprite animation documentation" href="https://p5play.org/learn/sprite_animation.html">sprite animation</a> function, specifically the 
              <b>Sprite Sheets with Multiple Animations</b> page. I took each frame from my gif file and positioned them 
              next to each other in a single image to create a sprite sheet (pictured). I then uploaded the sprite sheet into the web 
              editor to see the animation changes in real time. Once loaded, I used the <b>addAnis</b> function to encode 
              animation names as keys and sprite sheet atlases as values.

              At first, I had a bit of difficulty getting the proportions and spacings of the sprites in the sprite sheet 
              to make the animations show smoothly without being cut off as I was unfamiliar with the animation function.
              The documentation mentioned using same-size frames for the animation and putting them in order from left to right.
              Once I did this, my character sprite animations turned out perfectly without me needing to manually specify the 
              position of every consequent frame.

        <h2>Ideas & Future Work</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">From my project proposal, I was able to accomplish some of my stretch goals including:
        <ul class="ideas-list">
          <li>Implementing background music for the game</li>
          <li>Allow users to change game characters</li>
          <li>Increase game difficulty as time passes (as the duration of the game increases, the speed of the obstacles subsequently increase as well)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          An unanticipated setback was the amount of time I used to implement the sprites (specifically getting the animations to work). Due to 
          time constraints, I was unable to accomplish getting Firebase implemented to keep track of user high scores for my game. 
          This is something I would like to continue to work on if I were to have more time working on my project.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">Here are some additional ideas and features I would like to add to my game in the future!
        <ul class="ideas-list">
          <li>Get firebase implemented to effectively allow users to login and store their high scores</li>
          <li>Add more variety in the game characters 
            <br />&emsp;<i>Right now, I only have 2 so it would be fun to add a whole library of characters to pick from.</i>
          </li>
          <li>Have a way to for users to choose the game difficulty through pressing a key on the keyboard</li>
          <li>Implement a way for the game to work on mobile devices through tap mechanism</li>
          <li>Allow users to mute/unmute the background music 
            <br />&emsp;<i>The sound is currently defaulted to autoplay, so I tried out my game in different browsers and it
              worked in Safari, but not Chrome. 
            <br />&emsp;There's a
            <a title="chrome autoplay policy" href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/#webaudio">Chrome autoplay policy</a>, which prevents the music from 
            playing until the user has interacted with the domain.</i>
          </li>
          <li>Add in a more 'endless' component by allowing the user to collect and item and add a life</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
