        <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The core functionality of this project was to create the prototype for my final project. Since I really enjoyed creating a game for MP3, 
          I chose to create a new game: Boba Run (similar to Cookie Run and Google's dino run game).

           cloned to your own device -- note, you will need to install libraries, run a local development server, bundle the 
           code, and deploy the app on your own device.

              Since my firebase authentication and database was working, I then moved on to coding my game. To do this, I opened a new sketch on the p5.js Web Editor to start on my game. 
              I used the Web Editor as it has an embedded canvas so I could quickly iterate on my sketch and see changes 
              without needing to refresh the page.

              To code my cookie-run game, I started basic by using sprites to act as the 'game player' and 'obstacles'.

        <h2>Project Scope</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Now that I have completed my prototype, I feel like my project scope may need to be narrowed down as I do not 
          know if I have enough time to successfully implement Firebase within the time frame of the rest of the quarter. 
          Although I had set up Firebase, I have not yet linked my game to Firebase, so I am not sure if I can accomplish this 
          task by the time the final is due - firebase to store high scores and user authentication may be one feature I need to 
          remove from my anticipated final project due to timing constraints. However, I may be able to add additional 
          features of increasing game difficulty, changing game characters, and adding background music to enhance the 
          experience of my game.

      <div class="chunk">
        <h2>Time Management</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The amount of time I spent building my prototype was much more than my initial plan. 
          This is because I spent a lot of my time figuring out how Firebase worked (this was one anticipated roadblock as I had to read through their 
          documentation and look through the in-class activity again). Additionally, since I did not use the p5.play library for MP3,
          I had to look through their documentation to understand how to use sprites for my game.
          <br />
          One unanticipated roadblock was the complicity involved in using vite as a build tool versus what we had used with rollup for MP3. 
          I tried out using vite at first, but found rollup to be easier to work with as I had used it previously for MP3.

      <div class="chunk">
        <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          For my final version, I feel like I am slightly simplifying my implementation plan for my game now that I have completed
          my prototype. For my implementation plan for the final version, I plan to shift away from Firebase and focus more on implementing game features from my stretch goals 
          (increasing level difficulty, adding sound, new characters, etc.). Given the time left until the final version is due, if I have time I will attempt to make Firebase work to score users' high scores.
          This has changed because I want to manage my time effectively to ensure I make something I am happy with as well as ensure
          I can make something within my coding capabilities.
