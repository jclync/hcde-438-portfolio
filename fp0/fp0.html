        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The core functionality of this project was to write the code to use a modern web development 
          toolchain to structure and deploy an app, in which I chose to create a game app - Whack-A-Bee (inspired by the game whack-a-mole).

          Play the game 
          <a href="https://jclync.github.io/whack-a-mole/">here</a>. The code can be found in this 
          <a href="https://github.com/jclync/whack-a-mole">github repository</a> called "whack-a-mole". The repo can be
           cloned to your own device -- note, you will need to install libraries, run a local development server, bundle the 
           code, and deploy the app on your own device.

              One issue that I ran into was that the bee wouldn't disappear when it was clicked on -- but 
              only move after 'n' seconds had passed (I had used random to set 'n' seconds for the time the bee was to be in a certain position,
              and my mousePressed function only changed the score and lives depending on if the bee was clicked on). I 
              also was only able to set one bee on the screen, and I wanted to have the possibility to place more than one bee on the screen at 
              a time to increase game difficulty.

          Step-by-step plan for my development process:
        <ol class="ideas-list">
          <li>Increase game difficulty as time goes on (bees disappear much faster, more bees on screen, etc.)</li>
          <li>Add more variety in the happy and sad bees</li>
          <li>Have a way to for users to choose the game difficulty through pressing a key on the keyboard</li>
        </ol>
