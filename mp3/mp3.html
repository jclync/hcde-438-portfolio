        <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The core functionality of this project was to write the code to use a modern web development 
          toolchain to structure and deploy an app, in which I chose to create a game app - Whack-A-Bee (inspired by the game whack-a-mole).

              To start out, I created a new public Github

              that I called "whack-a-mole" to host the project for my game. 
              My game idea was inspired by the game 'whack-a-mole', so I chose this to name my new repo.

              After setting up my new repo, I opened a new sketch on the p5.js Web Editor to start on my game. 
              I used the Web Editor as it has an embedded canvas so I could quickly iterate on my sketch and see changes 
              without needing to refresh the page.
              <br /><br />
              To code the whack-a-mole game, I started basic by using rectangles to act as the 'mole'.

              After the game was functioning the way I wanted, I added in a Bee image to replace the rectangle shape and act as the 'mole'. I 
              also added in audio that played when the mouse was clicked on the Bee.
              I made some other edits and cleaned up my code as well to get to the final game app. 
              <br /><br />
              While making edits and changing my code, I routinely commited and pushed my code to Github alongside building 
              and deploying my app.

            <p class="issue-paragraph">
              One issue that I ran into was that the bee wouldn't disappear when it was clicked on -- but 
              only move after 'n' seconds had passed (I had used random to set 'n' seconds for the time the bee was to be in a certain position,
              and my mousePressed function only changed the score and lives depending on if the bee was clicked on). I 
              also was only able to set one bee on the screen, and I wanted to have the possibility to place more than one bee on the screen at 
              a time to increase game difficulty.

              By doing a search online, I found someone had created a <a title="hapiel's whack-a-mole game" href = "https://editor.p5js.org/hapiel/sketches/4srUmVHfj">minimalist whack-a-mole</a> on p5. 
              Following their code, I added in a Moles Class to make the moles appear and disappear on screen. Creating a new Moles Class allowed me to bundle attributes and attribute functionality
              for my bees in one place. More specifically, I was able to group the set of fields together (like x-Position, y-Position, size, and time duration for the bees to be on screen).

          <li>Increase game difficulty as time goes on (bees disappear much faster, more bees on screen, etc.)</li>
          <li>Add more variety in the happy and sad bees</li>
          <li>Have a way to for users to choose the game difficulty through pressing a key on the keyboard</li>
